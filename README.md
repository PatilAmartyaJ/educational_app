## Description
We have developed an educational app, E-Learn, which students can use to prepare for examinations like JEE, NEET and NTSE.

As we have focused mainly on major competitive exams students appear for in their higher secondary section, we have divided our resources into 4 sections : NTSE, PCM, PCB, and PCMB. 
User can select the category they want and they will be directed towards subject wise resources for that category.
For each section/category, there are separate pages for different subjects (like Physics, Chemistry, etc.)
These pages have several cards for chapters which lead to a short description of the topics covered under it. It further leads to the resources for that chapter.

We also have a test feature. It is a timed test. The users can attempt questions one-at-a-time and then proceed to the next question. On reaching the end of the test, there is a Submit button. The quiz gets submitted once the user presses the Submit button (or when the timer runs out). After submission, their score is displayed. The user may choose to view the solutions for the questions and also see which ones they got wrong. They can then go back to Home.

## Technology stack
1. Dart
2. Flutter
3. Firebase
4. AdobeXD

## Applications
Students (especially high schoolers) do not have proper resources to study for entrance examinations and other important tests, which are highly competitive. Existing resources are often behind a paywall or inaccessible. Our app helps such students by bringing to them all the required resources in one free app. We have chapter-wise resources for studying specific topics. We also have a test feature using which students may test their knowledge in exam-level time constraints. Thus, our app is very useful for NTSE/NEET/JEE-aspirants.

## What did you learn from this project
1. Amartya -
2. Sarah -
3. Reshmika - I learned how to use Dart and Flutter to develop cross-platform applications. I also learned how to store data using Firebase's Cloud Firestore. It was my first time working on App Development, so I learnt a lot.
4. Prachiti - I had an experience working with flutter and dart initially but this project helped me go deeper into the advanced aspects such as connecting flutter and firebase, I also learned about Firebase and all its features such as Cloud Firestore and Storage.
