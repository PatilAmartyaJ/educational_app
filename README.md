## Description
We have developed an educational app, E-Learn, which students can use to prepare for examinations like JEE, NEET and NTSE.

As we have focused mainly on major competitive exams students appear for in their higher secondary section, we have divided our resources into 4 sections : NTSE, PCM, PCB, and PCMB. 
User can select the category they want and they will be directed towards subject wise resources for that category.
For each section/category, there are separate pages for different subjects (like Physics, Chemistry, etc.)
These pages have several cards for chapters which lead to a short description of the topics covered under it. It further leads to the resources for that chapter.

We also have a test feature. It is a timed test. The users can attempt questions one-at-a-time and then proceed to the next question. On reaching the end of the test, there is a Submit button. The quiz gets submitted once the user presses the Submit button (or when the timer runs out). After submission, their score is displayed. The user may choose to view the solutions for the questions and also see which ones they got wrong. They can then go back to Home.

## Technology stack
1. Dart
2. Flutter
3. Firebase
4. AdobeXD

## Applications
Students (especially high schoolers) do not have proper resources to study for entrance examinations and other important tests, which are highly competitive. Existing resources are often behind a paywall or inaccessible. Our app helps such students by bringing to them all the required resources in one free app. We have chapter-wise resources for studying specific topics. We also have a test feature using which students may test their knowledge in exam-level time constraints. Thus, our app is very useful for NTSE/NEET/JEE-aspirants.

## What did you learn from this project
1. Amartya -At the time of starting  of this project I alreadt have less but not more experience about flutter.At that Time I wanted to build A simple quiz application at the Inheritance Project time , I made it very Hardcoded Since I don't know Any DBMS concepts or not details in Data Structures and algorithms.I feel very disappointed with it since whatever we need to do changes in the Question every Time we need to do changes in the code.The reason why I wanted to use Flutter here that it can ease your designing efforts as comapred to android and It also have Cross-platform approach.So my mainly focus was on the Databse part or you can Say backend part.I really enjoyed that with firebase,Firestore.The reason I wanna use firebase,Firestore is just simple having almost 1 GB free storageðŸ˜… and also direct connection between flutter and firebase as they are products of google.In this project I have taken deep dive into Flutter in terms of UI/UX designs,statemanagements and in firebase for Cool backend. And I am very ThankFul to DSC VJTI for giving me opportunity through amazing Skill Up 2.0.
This project is kind of startup for me and the Image animations are one of the part of my future plans that 40-45% of the study should be complete with the help of UI only,VideoLectures(I mean Conceptual Studies),The remaining 55% is more you can practise better you can improvein these Competetive exams  and I wanna Implement Total
Machine Learning in this part.And I wanna connect students with teachers and Motivational Speakers so It will give students inspiring brainFood,motivation so they can
ultimately reach to their goals.
And One more thing I improved in this group project that keep your Temper awayðŸ˜…,almost I am able to kill my temper and it is big acheivement for me,managing differnt
mentalities of every team member with respect to time is always challengingðŸ˜… and it was really fun.It gives me fuel to work hard for project and Sometimes lot of
frustationsðŸ˜…ðŸ˜….But seriously It was really nice,sweet and I wanna work more projects with you team.Thank you!
2. Sarah - Through Skill Up 2.0 I got the opportunity to explore the App Development Domain in which I had no prior experience. I learned dart and I also learned how to use the Flutter SDK for creating natively compiled, cross-platform applications. I learned a lot of things in Flutter like stateless & stateful widgets, futures, asynchronous functions, routes and navigation, state management, etc. I had already worked with firebase in a previous project, but through this project I got the chance to better understand and get a deeper grasp on certain concepts like Firebase Authentication,  Firebase Storage, storing and retrieving data from Cloud Firestore Database, etc. Altogether it was a wonderful experience collaborating and learning new things from my teammates. I would like to thank our mentor for being so supportive and guiding us throughout this project.
3. Reshmika - I learned how to use Dart and Flutter to develop cross-platform applications. I also learned how to store data using Firebase's Cloud Firestore. It was my first time working on App Development, so I learnt a lot.
4. Prachiti - I had an experience working with flutter and dart initially but this project helped me go deeper into the advanced aspects such as connecting flutter and firebase, I also learned about Firebase and all its features such as Cloud Firestore and Storage.

## Future Scope
We can add chapter-wise tests and add graphs for analysing the student's performance. More resources can be added for different chapters. There can also be a QnA section for students to ask their doubts and get them answered by peers and teachers.
